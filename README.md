# PYTHON PROJECTS
This repository contains all the mini Python projects that I've built while exploring different Python Libraries.
* [SNAKE-WATER-GUN](/SNAKE-WATER-GUN.py)
  This is a typical snake-water-gun aka rock-paper-scissor game built using random module and simple conditional statements where you can play against the computer. 
* [LibraryManagement](/LibraryManagement.py)
  A Library Management system which has the features of adding, lending and returning a Book. A simple implementation of OOP concepts.
* [Age-Calculator](/Age-Calculator.py)
  Calculates the age of the user, build using datetime module.
